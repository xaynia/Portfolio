**Gravity Jam** is a small game where you guide a falling object onto a target by creating gusts of wind with mouse clicks. Each variation (Feather Fall, Snowflake Sizzle, Laughing Skull) has its own unique theme and physics.

## How to Play

1. **Select a Variation:**  
   On the title screen:  
   - Use **UP/DOWN** arrows to highlight a variation and press **ENTER** to start.  
   - Or, **click** directly on a variation’s name to select it.

2. **Game Controls:**  
   Once in the game, the object falls automatically.  
   - **Click** anywhere to create a gust of wind nudging the object.  
   - Your goal is to land the object onto the target zone at the bottom.

3. **Navigation:**  
   - Press **ESC** to return to the title screen.  
   - Press **R** to retry the current variation.

## Streak

After each successful landing, your “streak” count increases. Consecutive successes without returning to the menu or failing will keep your streak going, displayed in the top-right corner.
