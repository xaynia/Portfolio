            description: 'A short Premiere Pro and After Effects music-video inspired by Flume and Ghibli.',
            longDescription: `In this experimental short, perfect symmetry dissolves into floral chaos, mirroring the interplay between 
        technology and nature. Anchored by a Flume-inspired electronic score, the film explores the delicate balance 
        between structured modernity and, paradoxically, AI-generated organic wonder. 

        Its central themes—reimagining our relationship to nature in the era of AI—are rooted in my Indigenous heritage 
        and influenced by artists Jon McCormack and Yoshi Sodeoka. Meanwhile, the stop-motion "vision" style pays homage 
        to Hayao Miyazaki, though it departs from his traditional methods to explore new forms of visual storytelling.

        Edited in Adobe Premiere Pro and After Effects, scenic aerial shots of the L’Anneau sculpture in downtown 
        Montreal flow in time with the music. While some may see the ring solely as a frame, it transforms into a portal
        for an AI-generated stop-motion “vision”: a walk through a symmetrical garden leading to the sculpture itself.
        At the height of the chaos, lush symmetrical flowers proliferate, overtaking the scene until the film reverses
        back to the AI-ring, then transitions again to the real ring—briefly merging the digital and physical worlds
        in a glitchy reveal.

        Inspired by psychedelic aesthetics, this short aims to provoke thought about chaos, symmetry, and how they 
        intersect. It also invites viewers to reflect on AI’s evolving role in artistic creation. 
        I chose to generate 52 AI-based stop-motion frames—drawing inspiration from Botanical 
        Gardens—to depict the journey from the garden to the ring. By juxtaposing a contemporary sculpture with 
        cutting-edge AI artistry, the film pays tribute to pioneering visionaries while weaving together themes of 
        chaos and symmetry in a striking modern homage.`,
